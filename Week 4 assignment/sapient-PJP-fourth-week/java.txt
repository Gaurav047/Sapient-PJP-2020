Addition br = new Addition();

Addition() is the object which is created inside the heap

br is the reference which is stored in stack having address of addition() object

garbage collection - reclaiming the runtime unused memory automatically 

if there is no reference referring to object, then only object will go for garbage collection, otherwise will present in the memory untill system is switched off

like -> free(br) , ob = null 

destructor is executed before the object went to garbage collection...executed within its scope and implements dispose techique
we need to free the references so that object go for garbage collection and execute destructor 

Dispose technique prevents starvation. Whatever resources we have used must be closed in destructor call. 

destructor in java - finalize() method

inheritance - resusability of code 

Arithmetic class for both addition and substraction

runtime polymorphism or dynamic binding
virtual function 

tightly and loosely coupled technique

overloading 
overiding 
in c++ -> we have scope resolution operator 
super.display 

scope of varibale 
static variable in Class Scope, all instances/objects will have the same copy
otherwise different copy
